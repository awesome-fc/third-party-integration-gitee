# FC Integrated With Gitee Callback Demo

This demo introduce a demo to intrgrate [Gitee](https://gitee.com/) with FunctionCompute using Gitee http callback to invoke function, and then function can read the Gitee event, such as code submmit, new commont. Gitee will send the corresponding event to function HTTP URL, then function read the event to upload code to OSS.

Default region name cn-xxxx
The timeout in seconds for each SDK client invoking 300
The maximum number of retries for each SDK client 5
Allow to anonynously report usage statistics to improve the tool over time? (Y/n)

```
2. Enter [Gitee](https://gitee.com/) webhook, and put your `id_rsa.pub` to Gitee SSH.

3. Open OSS service: 
  - Create a bucket
  - Upload the `id_rsa` and `my_ssh_executable.sh` file to bucket
4. Open FC service

## Step2: Deploy function
1. Run following command on the demo root pathï¼š

 ```
fun deploy -y # deploy function
```

## Step3: Test

Set the function URL to the Gitee webhook URL, and then trigger the event following, you will see the code is upload to your OSS bucket.
